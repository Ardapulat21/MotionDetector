<h3 align="center">Motion Detector</h3>
  <p align="center">
    The motion detector is designed to highlight moving objects in a video. It starts by decoding the video, which can come in various file formats. After decoding, it processes each frame to detect any movement. Once a moving object is identified, the system highlights it and then renders the processed frames in the viewer, providing a clear visualization of the detected motion within the video.No 3rd vision library(OpenCV,etc..) is used for detecting moving objects </p>
